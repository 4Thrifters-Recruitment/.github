## About the 4Thrifters Recruitment Organization 🚀

To manage our hiring process efficiently, we use a **separate GitHub organization** dedicated solely to recruitment tasks and submissions.

This organization and managing accounts are called:

**🔹 4Thrifters Recruitment (@4thrifters-recruitment)**

**🔹 Managing account is called 4thrifters Hiring Hub (@4thrifters-hiring)**

It is used **only for hiring purposes**, including managing candidate tasks, reviewing submissions, and handling GitHub Classroom repositories.

### Our Main Organization🌐

Our **main GitHub organization**, where all our actual product development and repositories live, is:

**4Thrifters (@thrifters)🏢**

This is our core org where we:
- Build and maintain our fashion + AI + sustainability tech products
- Host our backend, frontend, and AI codebases
- Collaborate on internal tools and infrastructure
- More about our mission, values, vision and Who we are.

---
By separating our recruitment and main development work, we ensure:
- Security and privacy for candidate submissions
- A clean, focused space for internal collaboration
- Scalability in hiring and engineering processes

Thank you for being part of the journey 💫
